### AI-Powered Weather App with Chatbot Assistant 🤖🌦️
---
## Overview
---
The AI-Powered Weather App is a modern web application developed during my internship at AI Wallah, designed to provide real-time weather updates with an engaging twist — an integrated AI chatbot assistant. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app combines traditional weather forecasting with AI-powered interactivity.
Users can check current weather conditions via the OpenWeather API and engage with the Weather Assistant chatbot, powered by the Gemini API, to ask questions about forecasts, clothing suggestions, and more — making the experience both functional and conversational.
